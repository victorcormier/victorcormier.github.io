        <h3>The Next Phase Begins</h3>    
            <p>Welcome to the first issue of Transformation Times. The purpose of this monthly e-newsletter is to provide you—our senior management team—with updates on the development and deployment of the transformation program. In future issues, we’ll be including news about communication packages, success stories, case studies and scorecards.</p> 
            <p>We’ve reached an important juncture. Much of our work so far has focused on developing the transformation vision and defining the program’s structure. Now, we are preparing to shift Our Transformation from development mode into a new phase of straight-ahead, systematic implementation.</p>
            <p>More than ever, it is vitally important that we are all firmly aligned in how we understand, implement and communicate this program. Transformation Times is one of the tools that will help us work together as we transform Schlumberger into one of the world’s best-run companies.</p>

                <p>A set of transformation management guidelines for Operations and Field Service managers is now available. Similar to the booklet created for GeoMarket managers and VPs, it has an added section on how these managers' roles will change and it outlines our plans to introduce the Continuous Performance Improvement organzation. Access a copy here. A printed copy of the booklet is being distributed to managers attending the InterChange in Sydney, Australia, and an electronic copy will be sent to all other Operations managers and FSMs during the second week of December.</p>

                <p>The Continuous Performance Improvement (CPI) organization has been formed to manage the implementation of the transformation program. Global CPI Manager Dominique Malard will lead a team of 60 managers in the Segments and GeoMarkets worldwide who will support line managers throughout the company in deploying a systematic global change management strategy.</p>
                <p>The mandate of the CPI organization is to support the field in implementing the transformation and ensure that together, we evolve to a new way of working in a consistent, effective and, most importantly, sustainable manner. The organization will be announced in January, however it will take until Q2 for all managers to be appointed. In conjunction with the new CPI organization, we will establish a Schlumberger Academy where CPI managers, all VPs and GeoMarket managers and presidents will receive tailored training to support the implementation of the transformation program. An integral part of their role will be to help foster a company-wide culture of continuous improvement and an unprecedented level of teamwork.</p>
                <p>A slide package introducing the organization has been distributed to the presidents and can be accessed here.</p>

            <p>The transformation’s action owners have one thing in common: they are responsible for the timely execution of some aspect of the program, whether it’s an initiative or building block, a Segment-led project or a GeoMarket-specific activity. The Transformation Toolbox is now accessible to all owners, who are asked to input specified data on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p>By providing a shared tracking tool and methodology, the toolbox serves as the single “source of truth” for planning timelines and viewing progress. The Transformation Toolbox is supported by online training materials geared to all action owners. Anyone requiring access to the toolbox can contact the PMO office at: transformationPMO@slb.com</p>
